			<p><strong>Things we own</strong> – are generally things that have a monetary value 
			(can be easily measured in money), <underline>they are sellable and/or enables us to generate income</underline>. 
			So all the significant things we own are called <strong>ASSETS</strong>. – Examples: car, house, shares in company, cash…</p>
			<br />
			<p><q>You Increase an Asset with [+] and you decrease it with [-]</q></p>
			<br />
     		<p><strong>Example:</strong> You buy a laptop and you pay in cash 500. So you have [+]500 laptop and [-]500 cash  </p>
     
     		<p><strong>How to distinguish if the money I spend are expenses or assets?</strong></p>
     		<p>It is up to you to decide. First look at the assets definition and if the money spent do not meet 
     		the criterias it is an expense. Here are some questions that can help you differentiate assets from expenses:</p>
			
				<p>Do you expect any income from your asset or is it a tool for income generation?</p>
				<p>Does it have significant material value?</p>
				<p>Do you expect it to have a significant material value after a year?</p>
				<p>Can you sell it after a long period of time (say a year)?</p>
			
			<p>If you have answered with Yes to some or all of the questions above 
			you probably have bought an asset.</p>
